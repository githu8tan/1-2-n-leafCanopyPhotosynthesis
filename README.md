# 1-2-n-leafCanopyPhotosynthesis

a series of file will be uploaded in the following days.
These matlab files is used to caclulate leaf and canopy photosynthesis. for the scaling, the big-leaf model, the sunlit-shade model and multilayer model was involved. I called them 1-leaf, 2-leaf, and n-leaf model, respectively. 

I firstly upload the analytic solution for leaf photosynthesis model. 
1. fAnalytic_BBerry_J.m: A matlab function calculate J with analytic solution of a cubic equation.
2. fAnalytic_BBerry_Vc.m: A matlab function calculate Vc with analytic solution of a cubic equation.
3. Main_Analytic_BBerry_v1_20250326.m: A matlab main function call fAnalytic_BBerry_... to calculate leaf photosyntheis rate.
